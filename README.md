A classic number-guessing game.

---

## Game Overview

The user tries to guess the randomly generated number (typically a 4-digit number) within a specified number of tries.</br>

Upon each guess, the user receives hints about the guess made:
- Cow: The number of cows indicates the number of digits that exist in the target number, but are at the wrong position.
- Bull: The number of bulls indicates the number of digits that exist in the target number and are also in the right place.

Using these hints, the user has to deduce the target number within **10** tries.
